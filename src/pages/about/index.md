title: About Janet Tolley Music
---
Music has been a tremendous blessing in my life.  I am a violinist by training (Bachelor of Music from BYU), an accompanist from experience, an organist through my church service, and a composer and arranger first from necessity, and more and more out of interest.  I still have a lot to learn.  I want to share my work so others can benefit.  

I have arranged hymns and primary music for specific circumstances and for specific instrumentalists.  I have arranged violin obligatos for students, string quartets for prelude, organ preludes, vocal trios, and violin solos with piano accompaniment.  I have composed a hymn for fathers, and a primary song from one of my favorite verses of scripture.  I enjoy the process, and learn by doing.
