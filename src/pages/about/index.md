title: About Janet Tolley Music
---
Music has been a tremendous blessing in my life.  I am a violinist by training (Bachelor of Music from BYU), an accompanist from experience, an organist through my church service, and a composer and arranger, first from necessity, and more and more out of interest.  I still have a lot to learn.  I want to share my work so others can benefit.  

I have arranged hymns and primary music for specific circumstances and for specific instrumentalists, arranged violin obligatos for students, string quartets for prelude, organ preludes, vocal trios, and violin solos with piano accompaniment.  I have composed a hymn for fathers, and a primary song from one of my favorite verses of scripture.  I enjoy the process, and learn by doing.
