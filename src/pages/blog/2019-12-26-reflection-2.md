RESTORE:“The action of returning something to a former owner, place, or condition.

I have been studying Alma 42.In verse 23 it says, “. . . and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God: and thus they are restored into his presence. . . “



We cannot be restored if we were not there before.I know we lived with Heavenly Father, as his children, before we came to this earth.



Verse 27 is one of my favorite scriptures.It brought me a lot of comfort when I served as Relief Society president and had stewardship over all of the sisters in the ward.



“Therefore, O my son, whosoever WILL come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be RESTORED unto him according to his deeds.”



Words and definitions are intriguing to study.Here is an interesting one.



WILL:To make a choice, choose” (as in do as you will)

“The mental faculty by which one deliberately chooses or decides upon a course of action.”

SO, if we WILL come, we may come.If we WILL we can choose to overcome bad habits, if we WILL we can practice more effectively, or use our time more wisely, or become more patient, etc.

I like the word deliberately.



I was teaching a piano student this week who tends to play kind of “floppy”.He does a good job learning the notes and rhythms, but his technique is “sloppy”.I told him to play more deliberately.To listen for his tone, have firm fingers, not just flop his way through it.When he followed my instruction his playing improved immediately.It was clean and clear, and firm.



What am I going to be more deliberate about this week?How I use my words.

I liked this quote from my daily quote wheel.

“Three tests:When I want to speak, let me think first – Is it true?Is it kind?Is it necessary?If not, let it be left unsaid!”(Babcock)



I hope I may have the WILL to DELIBERATELY CHOOSE words that lift and inspire, so that I may have good RESTORED unto me.
