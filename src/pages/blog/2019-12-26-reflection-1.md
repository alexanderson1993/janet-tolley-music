CREATION: Jehovah created the earth under the direction of Heavenly Father. I don’t know what my role was, but I know Michael assisted Jehovah.Grandpa Anderson built his house. I know Uncle David helped him and other men from the 33rd ward. What was Grandma’s role? I am certain she was in on the planning. Construction is often done by men/they are physically stronger. Grandma Tolley did much of the electrical work when they built their home. I have just begun learning how to paint this year. Emilysa painted our bathroom downstairs. I think Crystal painted some of her bedroom, too. Until recently I have had no desire to learn how to paint. It is just hard work, not particularly creative—except in the choice of colors. It has always been something the men did, but now I want to be more helpful to dad. I appreciate him so much.

I like sitting at the piano, making up a motif, exploring sounds and variations and chords.  I have a lot to learn, I may never be a real composer, but I have a desire to create.  It is easier on the violin.  Only one line at a time and I can find my way around with more ease (often in the key of G or D).

My Kodaly training has opened up my ears.  I can hear music (like the melodies from the soundtrack at the temple) and identify the sol-fa.  The more I learn the easier it is to hear, identify, and create.  Why didn’t I do more of this before now?  I did compose the “Jr. Prom theme” when I was in high school, but when the stage band director asked if I wanted to arrange it for the stage band I didn’t know where to start.  SO, he did it and we played it at the dance.  (I will have to pull it out sometime and play it again.)

I love being a mother and homemaker.  It takes creativity:to figure out how to meet a child’s need, to find a better way to motivate and guide, to adapt how I use my time, to stretch a dollar, to try a new recipe, or alter a pattern, or add sleeves to a prom dress, to play “bat and ball” in the romp room, to find new ways to express love, and to figure out what to eliminate when trying to do too much.

Teaching requires creativity.  It starts with perception, then problem solving, then communication.  I love teaching.  I love learning from other creative people—that includes learning from all of you.
