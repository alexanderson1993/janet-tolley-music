  I have arranged hymns and primary music for specific circumstances and for
  specific instrumentalists, arranged violin obligatos for students, string
  quartets for prelude, organ preludes, vocal trios, and violin solos with piano
  accompaniment.  I composed a hymn for fathers, and a primary song from one of
  my favorite verses of scripture, which I submitted to the hymnbook and
  children's songbook committe for consideration .  I enjoy the composition
  process, and learn by doing.
