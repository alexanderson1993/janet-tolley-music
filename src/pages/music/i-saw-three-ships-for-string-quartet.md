templateKey: music-piece
title: I Saw Three Ships - for string quartet
description: >-
  I originally arranged this piece for an "Old Fashioned Christmas" party, where
  live music was needed for dancing.

  Specifically for dancing "The Virginia Reel".  I revised it this year to
  perform at another Christmas party.  A String Quartet is always a hit
