title: About Janet Tolley Music
---
Music has been a tremendous blessing in my life.  I am a violinist by training (Bachelor of Music from BYU), an accompanist from experience, an organist through my church service, and a composer and arranger, first from necessity, and more and more out of interest.  I still have a lot to learn.  I want to share my work so others can benefit.
