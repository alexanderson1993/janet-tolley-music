title: About Janet Tolley Music
---
Music has been a tremendous blessing in my life.  I am a violinist by training, an accompanist from experience, an organist through my church service, and a composer and arranger, first from necessity, and more and more out of interest.  I still have a lot to learn and share.  

I grew up in a large, musical family. I began piano lessons at age 7, and violin lessons at age 8. I was a Suzuki violinist--my dad learned how to play the violin right along with my younger brother and me. My mother was our accompanist. By the time I was a Senior in high school, and enrolled in four music classes, I knew I wanted to major in music.    

I graduated from Brigham Young University in 1985 with a Bachelor of Music degree in violin pedagogy. I began teaching violin lessons while I was in college and have continued teaching for most of the past 35 years. As a mother of 8, and a homemaker, teaching violin/piano has been an ideal profession.
